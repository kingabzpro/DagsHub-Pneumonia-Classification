# Pneumonia-Classification

### This is a Python3 (TensorFlow) implementation of Pneumonia Detection using chest X-ray image.

## The Dataset

[comment]: <> (Uncomment when streamlit is merged into master    ![]&#40;task_5_streamlit/images/Example.png&#41;)

The dataset comprises 5,863 frontal-view chest X-ray images organized into three folders - train, test, val. 
The folders are divided into sub-folders for each image category - Pneumonia and Normal. 
[The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) is available on the Kaggle platform.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.5+
- All the specified requirements in the text file

## Usage
1) Clone this repository.
2) Install requirements.txt using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3) Use DVC to pull the files that are stored on the DAGsHub remote storage by running `dvc pull`
4) Modify the code as you wish. 
5) Run `dvc repro` to run the pipeline and train the model.

**Note:** *If you are adding/removing/moving files to different directories, it can affect the DVC pipeline, and therefore
the `dvc repro` command might not run properly.*
